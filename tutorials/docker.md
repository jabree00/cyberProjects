<h1>Docker</h1>
<p>Learn Docker was extremely difficult for me. I found that YouTube tutorials focused too deeply 
on the mechanics without giving me the high-level overview that I needed. I am hoping that this 
tutorial will alleviate problems for someone else in the future.</p>

<h2>What is Docker?</h2>
<p>Docker is a tool that allows use to bundle applications with all of their required dependencies and configurations.
This allows us to not only share our code or app or tool or service BUT also share the environment in which that tool
was made. This is important because the environment in which our code/app/tool was developed can impact how the program 
behaves. Therefore, someone running our code (without Docker) might get an error or experience different results.</p>
