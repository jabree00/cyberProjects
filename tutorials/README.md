<h1>Hi!</h1>

<p>In the name of Jesus, I am on a small but mighty mission to document my learning journey as I study for the CompTIA CySA+ exam, 
participate in Per Scholas cybersecurity training course, complete the Google Cybersecurity certification, complete multiple Cisco certs, 
AND take some other classes...for fun!

I have been learning SO much over the past six months that I have decided to start documenting my learning (with as much brevity as possible, 
considering my time constraints).                                                                                                             
                                                                        
I hope these tutorials and crash courses are helpful, but please excuse any errors or omissions while I try to output a quick overview of the topics. 

</p>
