<h1>YARA rules</h1>

<h1>The Why</h1>
I can use YARA to create rules for detecting malware. These files contain identifying details about a piece of malware, so when I investigate 
the malware, I can compare against the YARA rules. 

<h1>Testing Against Yara Rules</h1>
To test an executable against the ruleset, I must use the following syntax  

[executable name] [ruleset name] [result path]  

Example:  

sample02.exe rules.yara
