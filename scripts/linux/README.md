<h1>Linux Tutorials</h1>

<p>This folder is full of short Linux scripts demonstrating various tasks 
that can be completed via the Linux command line. While many of these tasks 
can be completed via a GUI (graphical user interface), the CLI 
(command-line interface) makes completing these tasks much faster and much 
more efficient.
